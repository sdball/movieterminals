    <h2>Alien (1979)</h2>
    <p>One of the first examples of a terminal text interface relaying key
    plot points.</p>
    <p>Its "Interface 2037" seems to be something of a natural English parser
    or its commands are unusually verbose. Unless you are an extreme
    <em>Alien</em> fan or have watched it very recently, you'll want to take a
    look at the command reference.</p>

    <h2>Tron (1982)</h2>
    <h3>Alan's Terminal</h3>
    <p>At the start of the movie <em>Tron</em>, Alan is attempting to work on his "Tron"
    program. Tron is a security program that monitors all contact between
    internal and external systems on the Encom network. Unfortunately for him,
    the MCP doesn't want any oversight and his access is suspended.</p>
    <p>The actual movie screen time of this terminal is very sparse, so I'm
    going to be padding this quite a bit with fun things to do. For that I made
    the assumption that the Encom developer terminals were using a variant of
    Unix. Even more, a variant of Unix with some system tools of the "future"
    (e.g. service).</p>
